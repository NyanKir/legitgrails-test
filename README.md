## Authorization
I would create a route for user authorization. The request body should include the user's ID and secret key.
Upon successful authorization, we generate a token and store it in our Redis cache.
However, the token will be deleted from Redis if the user stops using our service 
for a long period of time or if traffic originates from a different IP address(white-list).
In these cases, the user will need to re-authenticate.
## Rate limits
For user rate limiting, I will use Redis to count the number of requests in 10 seconds by Token.
If a user's token exceeds a certain limit, they will receive a 429 error.
After the wait period expires, they will be able to use our service again.
